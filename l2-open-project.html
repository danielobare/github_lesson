 <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
 
 
 
 The essence of this paper was to detail the Integration of Information Security Management and IT Alignment since it is known that the two are critical components in the operation of an organization. Through solid initiation and proper maintenance of relationships through knowledge sharing and customer engagement, a company can effectively achieve its goals and business objectives. Further, the integration of an organization’s IT strategy with the organization’s business strategy is key to the long-term future of the company. In this paper, interviews were conducted and featured 2 executive business roles: An executive manager and an executive director. 3 people holding IT-related roles in their organizations were also interviewed with responses being detailed from those with the more experienced roles. An IT Project Manager, an Information Security Manager and a Chief Information Officer were interviewed for the roles in the technology dockets. Executive directors responded to questions, learning much more about the business part and running of their individual companies. Questions on business strategy were also handled by them. The individuals in the IT fields were in a much better position to handle questions on the acquisition, deployment, maintenance and outlook of IT infrastructure and resources. Some of the roles were noted to cut across both teams and might require concerted efforts to tackle and so these were handled appropriately.
 
 
 
 
 
 <h2>Integrating Information Security Management and IT Alignment</h2>
 
 
 
 <h3>Executive Manager (Anonymous and a woman)</h3>
 
 
 
 <h4>What role do you have in your company?</h4>
 
 
 
 I am the Executive Director in our company’s Assurance department.
 
 
 
 <h4>What are your major responsibilities?</h4>
 
 
 
 At my company, I participate in the development and effective implementation of strategies aimed at promoting our company’s Assurance objectives and mission. I create business plans aimed at achieving set goals and objectives. I also organize the Assurance team by helping to build effective teams of leaders through providence of guidance to subordinate team members. 
 
 
 
 <h4>How many years of experience do you have with this company?</h4>
 
 
 
 I have 5 years of experience working in the Assurance department, having switched from Wealth & Asset management.
 
 
 
 <h4>How would you describe knowledge sharing among business executives in your company?</h4>
 
 
 
 Research has shown that the intellectual resources in the workplace, if not shared, will fail to reach the potential intended by the company. In our company, we value the idea of proper knowledge management and appreciate the value it has on developing skills and competencies, value appreciation and ability to sustain competitive advantages. We have taken specific steps to ensure seamless knowledge sharing among business executives by creating an open environment where trust is first built to enhance relevance, accuracy and totality of information and knowledge being shared. Our decision-making models collectively participated in giving all team leaders from the different departments a chance to extensively share their ideas. Knowledge is easily shared when team members understand how it is going to be used and what benefits might come about because of sharing ideas and feedback. Among others, these are the main ways which we go about knowledge sharing not just among business executives but also the rest of the workforce in our company.
 
 
 
 <h4>What are some of the barriers to knowledge sharing that your company experiences?</h4>
 
 
 
 We have seen productivity go up since we solved the challenge of knowledge-sharing and the culture that involves knowledge-sharing. After our previous internal survey that sought to identify key barriers to effective knowledge sharing, we realized that there is a lack of informational awareness on the importance or even the existence of knowledge sharing. Corporate culture also featured among what hinders effective knowledge sharing. Distance between individuals and teams was found to have an impact on the free flow of knowledge in the workplace environment. We have however leveraged on modern IT resources to minimize the impact of distance on productivity. 
 
 
 
 <h4>What challenges are you most concerned about to improve knowledge sharing?</h4>
 
 
 
 IT resources that facilitate the seamless interaction of teammates such as video conferencing infrastructure, team working with productivity software and finances available to coordinate on training of the workers are expensive to obtain, deploy and maintain. This has been a big challenge considering most of the workforce consists of the quote and quote, old-fashioned accountants, and tax consultants.
 In your own opinion, do you think that your company’s business and IT executives have a shared understanding and can agree on how the IT project can be a competitive advantage?
 We have taken a detailed approach on how we go about designing and executing our competitive advantage. Constant communication between the business executives of all departments and IT managers exists where feedback is constantly sought. Identifying and enrolling our executives into professional certifications packages that impart skills on developing shared understanding and competitive advantage has been a top priority to ensure that there is effective collaboration and definite route to assuring of the company’s continued increasing profit margins.
 
 
 
 <h4>To what extent does the company adopt the goals and objectives of Information Security to the goals and objectives of the company?</h4>
 
 
 
 Information security is a key component in our company’s functioning since we handle data from various clients. Information security is also important in safeguarding our own data and that is why we have allowed for the development of close business relationships where time to discuss important matters between business executives and the company’s IT leaders is set aside. We believe in asking the right questions to be having a zero in on matters that touch on IT technologies, operations, and strategies we have adopted. By building trust based on total transparency, owning challenges, and accepting that people are all vulnerable has allowed us to better strengthen partnerships. These are some of the measures the company has taken to ensure align Information security goals to the objectives of the company.
 
 
 
 <h4>Do you think that your company is adapting its strategy to strategic changes?</h4>
 
 
 
 Yes.
 
 
 
 <a>What approaches has your company taken to ensure adapting its strategy to strategic changes?</a>
 
 
 
 Our strategy department has taken a four-point view to ensuring aligning of business strategy in all fronts. These are Pioneer, Expand, Reorient, and Dominate. These serve to highlight the primary challenges for the business departments in all contexts. We also have four key elements of our company’s strategic planning process: Goal setting direction, patterns of time-spending in the planning process, the importance of a strategic budget and the interlinking of the financial plan and budgets. We manipulate all these to suit the firm’s needs.
 
 
 
 <h3>Executive Director (Interviewee is a man)</h3>
 
 
 
 <h4>What role do you play in your company?</h4>
 
 
 
 I participate in the collective creating of remedial actions for the mitigation of crisis and issues arising. Conducting crisis management, overseeing investment efforts, acting as the public representative of the company to help strengthen public outlook and profile are among my main responsibilities apart from being the main leader in my department.
 
 
 
 <h4>What are your major responsibilities?</h4>
 
 
 
 Building a team that delivers by guiding and coaching team leaders below me is my core responsibility at the company. I create and manage relations with shareholders, regulatory authorities, and partners to maintain trust. Regularly reviewing reports from the different sub departments that I head to better understand the financial and non-financial position is another responsibility I handle.
 
 
 
 <h4>How many years of experience do you have with this company?</h4>
 
 
 
 Having worked in the banking industry from the start of my professional career, I have a total of 25 years in the industry. I have worked in HSBC investment and Banking department, at Morgan Stanley as a Business Account Manager, in the public sector as the Assistant Controller of budget and now at my present workplace as the executive director in Taxation and Tax Administration. 
 How would you describe knowledge sharing among business executives in your company
 We have a centralized knowledge sharing policy where our Feedback Managers regularly collect views, opinions and points of perspective and consolidate them into reports. However, we are not limited to this method as we advocate for open communication to ensure effective discussions, which has seen our productivity going up.
 
 
 
 <h4>What are some of the barriers to knowledge sharing that your company experiences?</h4>
 
 
 
 The banking industry has sensitive departments that have promoted knowledge hoarding due to the direct and indirect consequences associated with giving specific feedback. It is difficult for some people to create and maintain relationships thereby limiting our ability to reach potential seen in knowledge-sharing.
 
 
 
 <h4>What challenges are you most concerned about to improve knowledge sharing?</h4>
 
 
 
 Our company is comprised of a youthful workforce. They usually lack the relevant experience required to effectively give a long-term view of the banking-investment industry. It has been noted that the time taken to participate in knowledge sharing is too much and as such, such activities eat into employees who have busy schedules. Other Knowledge management tools require long learning curves that require a lot of time to acquire and participate in.
 In your own opinion, do you think that your company’s business and IT executives have a shared understanding and can agree on how the IT project can be a competitive advantage?
 The company understands that IT projects are important to gaining a competitive edge over our competitors and that is why we have training, webinars and talks based on shared understanding and integration between our business and IT executives. So, I am confident that our business and IT managers have a perfect and shared understanding. How IT projects can be leveraged as a tool of competitive advantage is amicably agreed on.
 
 
 
 <h4>To what extent does the company adopt the goals and objectives of Information Security to the goals and objectives of the company?</h4>
 
 
 
 Our goals and objectives regarding Information Security are all geared to safeguarding transactions and providing a key platform in the interaction of and with banking services. We have a heavy bias of aligning our company’s objectives with those of Information Security.
 
 
 
 <h4>Do you think that your company is adapting its strategy to strategic changes?</h4>
 
 
 
 Yes. We progressively monitor our time-spending models, the importance of a strategic budget and the budget itself and the inter linkage of all these various aspects of planning. By adapting our company’s strategy to our strategic changes, we are setting the pace for the future of banking.
 
 
 
 <h4>What approaches has your company taken to ensure adapting its strategy to strategic changes?</h4>
 
 
 
 I think I have spoken about that in the immediate previous question.
 
 
 
 <h3>Chief Information Officer, Bleps Technologies.</h3>
 
 
 
 <h4>What role do you have in your company?</h4>
 
 
 
 I am responsible for the formulation and setting of our company’s business objectives and strategies on behalf of the IT department. Identifying and deploying relevant technology to enhance efficiency in operations is also a role I play in my company. I have been part of teams that I lead in designing and the customization of technology systems that aim at improving customer experience.
 
 
 
 <h4>How many years of experience do you have with this company?</h4>
 
 
 
 10 years of experience in the company.
 
 
 
 <h4>How well does the company align IT investments and expenditures with its objectives and priorities?</h4>
 
 
 
 The company has set clear objectives and is majorly using the latest technologies. This requires heavy capital investments in IT infrastructure and resources. Expenditure on training staff on how to use these systems is also well planned and documented for. The company’s objectives are among the many, adopting business sustainability in the management & operations of the company and realizing emerging frameworks in the proper operation ability of the IT department and the company.
 
 
 
 <h4>Is the company adapting IT to strategic changes and how is it doing it?</h4>
 
 
 
 Yes. We have a robust team that ensures compliance with the local regulatory bodies ensuring integrity is observed in all parts of the process, cultivating the right company culture, policy, and governance, employing cost effectiveness in the implementation of security protocols.

 As the head of information in my company, I seek to uphold the key position of information, information security and information security strategies in the outlook of the company and in its operations.
 
 
 
 <h4>How well does the company align IT investments and expenditures with its information security strategy?</h4>
 
 
 
 
 We are always setting aside budget for acquisition and the implementation of new IT resources with the goal of achieving its information security standards.
 
 
 
 
 <h3>IT Project Manager (Anonymous and is a woman)</h3>
 
 
 
 <h4>What role do you have in your company?</h4>
 
 
 
 I am involved in the proper management of IT and computer systems acquired by the company. I lead a team of competent IT staff and participate in the management and evaluation of IT and operations involving electronic data.
 
 
 
 <h4>How many years of experience do you have with this company?</h4>
 
 
 
 I started out as an associate and have climbed up the ladder to IT Project Manager in a span of just 3 years. This has been due to my challenging work and commitment to achieving personal goals.
 
 
 
 <h4>How well do business executives know the IT environment?</h4>
 
 
 
 They understand quite a lot. Apart from our Chief Technology Officer, business executives are involved in the setting up of budget for the acquisition and running of such IT resources, the acquisition of top-level IT personnel and review reports on the effectiveness of the IT infrastructures that the company is in possession of. Executive leaders are trained in understanding the IT environment to better integrate IT into the business.
 
 
 
 <h4>Is the company aligning IT strategies with its strategic plan?</h4>
 
 
 
 Yes, we must always update and make sure our company’s IT strategies are in line with the company’s strategic plan. This is done in cooperation with the other business managers from other groups to ensure seamless integration.
 
 
 
 <h4>Do you believe the company aligns IT with company’s needs?</h4>
 
 
 
 Yes. The company is by itself a technology solutions company offering cloud services consultation and human personnel outsourcing, we therefore must keep up with the existing technologies and ensure they are interoperable with the company’s needs. This way, the company can focus on productivity and making a difference in the field of operation.
 
 
 
 <h4>How well does the company align IT investments and expenditures with its objectives and priorities?</h4>
 
 
 
 The company aims to acquire IT resources at the lowest possible prices and sets aside enough finances for their daily operations. The company is all about reducing costs so by spending less on resource acquisition, we are in line with the company’s objectives and priorities.
 
 
 
 <h4>To what extent do IT projects meet the company’s commitments?</h4>
 
 
 
 IT projects are undertaken to simplify future changes in technologies and the proper achievement of the firm’s daily operations. If the company gains direct observable advantages from this, then it is meeting the company’s commitments.
 
 
 
 <h4>How does your company approach IT projects performance or how is the success of IT projects measured?</h4>
 
 
 
 We perform technical and economic analysis, information testing systems, mathematical and statistical computation of risks by doing risk analysis, among others. This is to justify investment and check on returns while seeking to cut down on nonperforming IT projects or resources.
